# Spark Executor Memory Management

This document explains the memory management model in Apache Spark, using an example of an executor with **10 GB of memory**. We cover how the memory is allocated for execution, storage, JVM overhead, and system processes.

## Memory Allocation Overview

In Spark, an executor is allocated a certain amount of memory, and this memory is shared between different components of the application. By default, Spark uses a **unified memory model** in which the memory is dynamically split between:

- **Execution Memory**: Memory used for computation (e.g., shuffling, sorting, aggregations).
- **Storage Memory**: Memory used for storing data (e.g., cached RDDs, DataFrames, broadcast variables).

### Example: Executor with 10 GB Memory

Let’s assume an executor with **10 GB of memory**:

- **Total Memory**: 10 GB
- **Unified Memory Pool (60% of total memory)**: 6 GB
  - **Storage Memory (50% of unified pool)**: 3 GB
  - **Execution Memory (50% of unified pool)**: 3 GB
- **Remaining Memory (for JVM overhead, system processes, etc.)**: 4 GB

### Breakdown of Memory Components:

1. **Unified Memory Pool** (6 GB):
   - **Storage Memory** (3 GB) is used for storing data like cached RDDs and broadcast variables.
   - **Execution Memory** (3 GB) is used for running tasks, such as shuffle operations, aggregations, and transformations.

2. **Remaining Memory** (4 GB) is reserved for the following purposes:

### 1. JVM Overhead

The JVM itself requires memory for several internal processes:

- **JVM Internal Data Structures**: For storing class metadata, bytecode, etc.
- **Garbage Collection (GC)**: Periodic cleanup of unused memory. The JVM requires space for objects and references during the garbage collection process.
- **JVM Stack**: Each Spark task runs on its own thread, which has its own stack space for method calls and local variables.
- **Native Memory**: For low-level operations like I/O, JNI (Java Native Interface), and other JVM internal operations.

### 2. System Processes & Operating System Needs

The **remaining memory** is also shared with the operating system and system processes:

- **Operating System**: Memory used by the OS for managing processes, scheduling tasks, and handling system-level activities.
- **Disk and Network Buffers**: Spark may use buffers for reading/writing data during shuffle operations or spilling to disk.
- **Thread Management**: OS also manages Spark’s threads, which require memory for scheduling and execution.

### 3. Spark-Specific Memory Needs

Spark can be tuned to allocate extra memory for various overheads:

- **`spark.executor.memoryOverhead`**: Memory set aside for off-heap memory, shuffle buffers, and internal buffers. This memory is critical for smooth Spark execution.
  
  Example configuration:
  ```bash
  spark.executor.memoryOverhead = 1g  # For a 10 GB executor, 1 GB overhead is allocated by default.
